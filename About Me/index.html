         <p>Code Geass is my favorite show to watch and I highly recommend people to watch it. Each character is fully fleshed out by the second season. Any of the characters could be your favorite, due to the character developement being so good. It also touches on issues on how  everything is not black and white, but shades of grey.  Aswell as that time stops for no one and that's why I absolutely love this show.</p>

         <p>Spectaclar Spiderman is one of my favorite show, but the most impactfull due to it showing me at a young age the feats of what animation can do. The show has showed what good writing is ,and that it can look and sound great. It also showed someone struggling with their multiple identies.One them is an average highschool student named Peter Parker with a very big intellegence. The other one is a hero known by all  and loved by many, but hated by some evil villians.  It's spiderman who is Peter Paker in disguise, but comes about when everyone notices he is out late, hiding something, and/or known he is spiderman. This adds alot of dramatic irony to the show which creates alot of supense. Thats is how it impacted my life</p>

        <p>I like the new show Daring In the Franxxx and is quickly might become my favorite show. I like shows that hid stuff in the background. When the show hinted at the main characters' death throught the series. In episode 20, everyone is about blow up for good and the episode ends. I was okay with how they ended the episode and if it was the end for show I would like it.</p>
